# My CPR school - Hands on Hearts

# Description

This project is for my CPR school that offers First Aid, CPR & AED classes. Users can
sign up/log in for an account using their email. Also, users can reset password with forgot password. Users can browse for classes and register for classes.

The frontend was built using Reactjs and Tailwind CSS. Google Firebase is used for the backend, users authentication and firestore databse.

Some of the challenges I faced was integration firestore database and firebase authentiation in my react app.

Some features that I would like to implement in the near future is payment via paypal and cc.
