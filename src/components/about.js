				<p class='p-16 md:p-20 text-left text-clip overflow-hidden'>
					Our mission is to provide the highest quality training and services
					possible. We are extremely flexible in accommodating our clientsâ€™
					needs and requests. Above all else we understand that there is a
					certain level of nervousness when taking any class and we understand
					that. Our solution is to provide a supportive and encouraging
					environment that builds a student up and all of our instructors will
					do as much as possible to make everyone feel at ease and comfortable
					with the class. Courses have requirements that are set forth by the
					American Red Course and we do all we can do to help students achieve
					success in the classes. In addition we always try to bring a good
					sense of humor, fun and sometimes some good doughnuts to our classes
					because if we cannot enjoy it, our students will not enjoy the
					experience!
